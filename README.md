A Maze Solving Bot based on Reinforcement Learning
Enter the number of rows and columns you want for the maze
Select the number of holes, and as this is fully customizable, you can enter the coordinates of all the holes
Also, specify the end point which is the target
The number of epochs is the times you want to train the maze. Higher the epoch count, better the performance
Rest assured and watch the bot undergo the training and finally figure out the way
